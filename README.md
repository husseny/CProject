Nutrition
weight and fat percentage
LBM 
BMR (Basic metabolism) 
Then use a separate excel to multiply the BMR to get the TDE
TDE (total day energy)
to lose calories => TDE - .2* TDE
to gain muscles => TDE + .2*TDE
TDE to eat ( Protein, Carbs, Fat)
Get fat = .4 * LBM in pounds
Get protein = 1.5(losing)/1.6(bulking) * LBM in pounds
(TDE  - (Fat*9) + (Protein *4) )/4 = Carbs 
Range of carbs tolerance 100 calories downwards if he is losing
Range of carbs tolerance 100 plus downwards and upwards if he is bulking.
Range of fat is +- 5g
Range of protein is upwards 30g
higher and lower bounds for all meals and deltas for changes
